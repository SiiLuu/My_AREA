# AppMobile

Mobile part for the AREA project made by Julien Salies and Tom TRIQUET using Flutter.
https://flutter.dev/

## Getting Started

To get the .apk to use the app you need to:

    ```bash
    sudo docker-compose build
    sudo docker-compose up
    ```

    Then go to "http://localhost:8081/client.apk" to download the .apk file

If you decide to change the URL of the server, you'll need to modify the request destination URL in "lib/Models/const.dart"
